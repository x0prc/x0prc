# Hello! I am PRC.

**Reverse Engineering | Low-Level Systems | Machine Learning**

## What I Do

* Reverse engineer binaries, malware, and protected executables
* Design and exploit **attack surfaces in APIs, kernels, and protocols**
* Build **offensive security tooling** and research-grade PoCs
* Analyze **post-quantum and privacy-preserving security models**
* Work close to the metal: **assembly, OS internals, memory, hooks**

## Selected Projects

* **QREP** – Post-quantum security & differential privacy research framework
* **FuzzRex** – OpenAPI-driven API fuzzing and misconfiguration discovery
* **PrismGhidra** – Ghidra plugins for binary debugging, taint analysis, and visualization
* **GlowRK** – Rootkit behavior analysis & kernel-level detection techniques
* **PotSniffle** – Cross-platform honeypot for attacker behavior profiling
* **RTA-Plugin** – Real-time network anomaly alerts for Wireshark
* **AnR2** – Anonymous routing PoC using garlic routing
* **FDE-Turbo** – Full-disk encryption helpers for Linux & Windows
